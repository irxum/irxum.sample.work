## Data Visualizations
  
[L.A. Property Crime Occurrences](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.kwan5873#!/vizhome/AK_midterm_project_v2/Dashboard)  
I used Tableau and public L.A.P.D. crime data for this visualization.
  
[Stolen Vehicles & Burglaries per Quarter](https://irxum.github.io/ddv_project/ddvp_p1.html)  
I used d3.js and public L.A.P.D. crime data for this interactive visualization.


  
## Data Science Projects

[Tracking & Latitude During Summer Solstice](https://github.com/irxum/irxum.sample.work/wiki/Tracking-&-Latitude-During-Summer-Solstice)  
I carried out some solar tracking quantitative analysis in Python using the pvlib package.  

[Residential Solar Rate Analysis](https://irxum.github.io/irxum.sample.work/Residential_Solar_Demand_Rate_Analysis.ipynb)  
This is a sample rate analysis on a hypothetical residence with a solar plus storage system.

[Joint Analysis of Hotel Review & Historical Local Economy Metrics for Causal Topics](https://irxum.github.io/causality/)  
I employed text mining of hotel reviews to extract sentiments and topics with R using the stm package.  

[Skin Cancer Classification using LDA, RF, & SVM](https://github.com/irxum/psl_proj2/blob/master/Project2_akwan2.ipynb)  
I utilized LDA, RF, and SVM to perform classification of malignant and benign skin cancer lesions with Python using the scikit-learn and scikit-image packages.

[Wine Review and Recommendation with Regression Analysis](https://github.com/irxum/psl_proj1/blob/master/Project1_akwan2.Rmd)  
I employed the glmnet and caret packages in R to perform regression analysis to predict wine review scores.  The feature engineering included sentiment analysis on text reviews.

[European Employment & Accelerometer Clustering](https://irxum.github.io/irxum.sample.work/AlexKwan_hw4.pdf)  
I used hierarchical clustering to evaluate European employment data and vector quantization to evaluate accelerometer data.  R scripts found [here](https://github.com/irxum/irxum.sample.work/blob/master/hw4_prob1.R) and [here](https://github.com/irxum/irxum.sample.work/blob/master/hw4_prob2_AB_v2.R).  

[Seasonality of Stolen Vehicles](https://irxum.github.io/irxum.sample.work/AlexKwan_StolenVehicles.pdf)  
I used multivariate linear regression to assess how seasons may affect frequency of stolen vehicles.  The .pdf includes the python script.

[Scrubber for Reactive Gases - US Patent 7829046B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f4/e1/6f/1b7d64ed24620a/US7829046.pdf)  
I contributed to this work while I was with [Spectrasensors](https://www.spectrasensors.com), a laser-based instrumentation company.  

[Nanoscale Calorimetry of Isolated Polyethylene Single Crystals](http://allen.matse.illinois.edu/pdf/allen_jpsb_060101.pdf)  
I was the first author in this published article in the _Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics_.
