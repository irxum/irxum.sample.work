# Tracking & Latitude During Summer Solstice

## Purpose

Attempt to understand the relationship between latitude and tracking as during Summer Solstice 

(Python script is located [here](https://github.com/irxum/irxum.sample.work/blob/master/latitudeEval.py).  The user specific inputs may need to be adjusted in rows 20-40)

## Part 1.  What does the tracking profile look like as latitudes increase during the Summer Solstice?  

Assuming a GCR of 0.35, we can now plot the tracking profile while changing the latitude of the site location.  The tracking profiles are for 2017 Summer Solstice which is the day of year that daylight and night time are most similar.   The plot below is the tracking profile color-coded to latitude.
